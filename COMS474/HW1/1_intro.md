# Why Machine Learning (ML)

- How computers know how to do things?
- Two ways:
    1. programming: steps detailed by human programmer
    2. learning: without being specifically told 
- Example 1: machine translation
    1. programming: writing many rules to replace and reposition words, e.g., 
    _Do you speak Julia?_ _Sprechen Sie Julia?_   
    2. learning: feeding the computer many bilingual documents 
- Example 2: sorting 
    1. programming: Quicksort, etc.

- O(log(n))
